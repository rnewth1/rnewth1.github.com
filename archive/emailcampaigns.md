I have created a number of email campaigns using both MailChimp and HubSpot. This has involved creating assets, creating layouts and ensuring that they display correctly in multiple email clients.

<h2>iCheev</h2>

These emails inform users of the new features and updates to iCheev.

<h2>ThinkOn</h2>

These campaigns are used to invite users along to programmes and keep them up-to-date with the latest insights and tips.

<h2>Go MAD Thinking</h2>

Before rebranding to ThinkOn, I also created the Go MAD Thinking email campaigns.
