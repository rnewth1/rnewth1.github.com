This is a concept for a digital platform that I am currently working on for ThinkOn.

Itâ€™s purpose is to be a central dashboard, tying together a number of apps and passing data through their APIs.

The styling had to complement the ThinkOn brand, but also tie in with iCheev (their digital offering) and Skilljar (where their online courses are hosted).

The platform needed to be intuitive and have a familiar feel.

I created a clickable prototype with InVision, carried out user feedback sessions, recorded the feedback and made changes based on the common themes.
