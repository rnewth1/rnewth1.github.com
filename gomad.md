Go MAD Thinking was the original name for <a href="http://rnewth1.github.com/thinkon">ThinkOn</a>, before rebranding in late 2015.

I designed and developed the custom, responsive Wordpress theme. It was therefore easy to update and maintain. 

I also used an ecommerce plugin to create a shop which sold books, eBooks and CDs.

The site also had a range splash pages which delivered sales offers, as shown below.
