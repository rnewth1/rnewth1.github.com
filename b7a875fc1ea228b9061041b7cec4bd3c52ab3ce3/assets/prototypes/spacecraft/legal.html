                                                                the data is stored on the server and not in the cookie.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <p>Both of these cookies are required for Spacecraft sites to operate and do not contain personal data. Spacecraft therefore consider these cookies necessary in order to provide a service to the user
                                                            as part of which they have requested by using the web site. These cookies are set to expire as soon as a user quits their browser.</p>
                                                        <p>We also use Google Analytics to measure site usage and build a better user experience.</p>
                                                        <p>Google Analytics sets the following cookies:</p>
                                                        <h2>__utma Cookie</h2>
                                                        <p>A persistent cookie - remains on a computer, unless it expires or the cookie cache is cleared. It tracks visitors. Metrics associated with the Google __utma cookie include: first visit (unique visit),
                                                            last visit (returning visit). This also includes Days and Visits to purchase calculations which afford ecommerce websites with data intelligence around purchasing sales funnels.</p>
                                                        <h2>__utmb Cookie &amp; __utmc Cookies</h2>
                                                        <p>These cookies work in tandem to calculate visit length. Google __utmb cookie demarks the exact arrival time, then Google __utmc registers the precise exit time of the user.</p>
                                                        <p>Because __utmb counts entrance visits, it is a session cookie, and expires at the end of the session, e.g. when the user leaves the page. A timestamp of 30 minutes must pass before Google cookie
                                                            __utmc expires. Given__utmc cannot tell if a browser or website session ends. Therefore, if no new page view is recorded in 30 minutes the cookie is expired.</p>
                                                        <p>This is a standard 'grace period' in web analytics. Ominture and WebTrends among many others follow the same procedure.</p>
                                                        <h2>__utmz Cookie</h2>
                                                        <p>Cookie __utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from, with the referrer siloed into type (Search engine (organic or cpc), direct, social and unaccounted). From the HTTP

                                                        <p>This cookie lasts six months. In tracking terms this Cookie is perhaps the most important as it will tell you about your traffic and help with conversion information such as what source / medium

                                                        <h2>__utmv Cookie</h2>
