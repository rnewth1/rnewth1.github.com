ThinkOn Business Gamechangers are a unique consultancy who partner with organisations across the world to enable change and accelerate results. 

This is a content driven website, showing the purpose of the company, useful articles and media, and captures relevant data to generate leads. The brand is down to earth, clean and quirky.

I worked closely with a branding expert to design the website, ensuring that it met all brand guidelines. 

As the site would need updating regularly, it was of upmost important that anyone could upload and edit content. To achieve this, I developed a custom Wordpress theme with appropriate plugins, to give maximum flexibility.

The site is also fully responsive using the Bootstrap framework, so it appears beautifully across a range of screen sizes and devices.

<h2>Tablet</h2>

Here the homepage is displayed on a tablet. The menu has been replaced my an icon, suitable for touch devices, and the layout has adjusted to display the content appropriately.

Here the homepage is displayed on a mobile device. The layout has been adjusted further, ensuring maximum usability for use on the go.

<h2>The people page</h2>

The quirky people page gives the impression that the faces on screen follow your cursor. This was achieved by taking 9 photos of each person, then using a script to show the appropriate image dependant on the cursor position.
