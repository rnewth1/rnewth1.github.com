ThinkOn Business Gamechangers are a unique consultancy who partner with organisations across the world to enable change and accelerate results. 

The purpose of the site is to give an insight of what the company does and generate leads to potential clients. The brand is down to earth, clean and quirky.

Design, inital concepts with brand guidelines - worked with external branding expert.

It was a requirement for the site needed to be easily updated and maintained by the marketing team, so I created a custom Wordpress theme to give maximum flexibility. 

The site is also fully responsive, so appears beautifully across a range of screen sizes and devices.

The quirky people page gives the impression that the faces on screen follow your cursor. This was achieved by taking 9 photos of each person, then using a script to show the appropriate image dependant on the cursor position. You can see an example below:
